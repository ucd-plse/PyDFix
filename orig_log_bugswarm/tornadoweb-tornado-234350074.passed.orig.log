Some tests were skipped because: SO_REUSEPORT is not supported, curl
client accepts invalid headers, dual-stack servers often have port
conflicts on travis, needs fix, no testable future imports, non-
windows platform, pycares module not present, timing tests unreliable
on travis, tornado.speedups module not present, twisted web not
